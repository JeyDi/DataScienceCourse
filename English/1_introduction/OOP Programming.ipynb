    "Encapsulation is precisely linked to the concept of \"packing\" in an object the data and actions that can be traced back to a single component.\n",
    "It is also considered as the first principle of object programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at encapsulation, which we have already mentioned, is to think about dividing an application into small parts (the objects, precisely) that group together some functions linked to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think of a bank account. The useful information (properties) could be represented by: account number, balance, customer name, address, account type, interest rate and opening date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions that operate on this information (the methods) will be: opening, closing, deposit, withdrawal, change of account type, change of customer and change of address. The Account object will encapsulate this information and actions within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of encapsulation is to limit the effects of changes to a software system.\n",
    "A concept similar to encapsulation is also called: Information Hiding.  \n",

    "### Abstraction\n",
    "Inheritance is the second fundamental principle of object oriented programming. In general, it is a mechanism for creating new objects that are based on others already defined.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A child object is defined as one that inherits all or part of the properties and methods defined in the parent object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As said before, imagine that the parent class is: robot, which is the basic definition of the characteristics of Voltron robots.  \n",
    "The parent objects will be all individual robots with their unique characteristics different from each other!\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest advantages of using inheritance is the easier maintenance of the software. In fact, following the example of mammals, if something should change for the entire class of robots, perhaps introducing new features available to all, it will be sufficient to modify only the parent object to allow all child objects to inherit the new feature.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Also imagine to have in the father class a method: `movement` that defines the standard type of robot movement, each child robot will be able to ignore this functionality of the father class by making its own \"version\" of the movement (maybe flying!).  \n",
    "This concept of fundamental importance calls: **overriding**, i.e. every object derived from a parent class has the possibility to ignore one or more methods defined in it by rewriting those methods within it.  "

  },
  {

   "source": [
    "### Polymorphism\n",
    "The third fundamental element of object programming is polymorphism. Literally, the word polymorphism indicates the possibility for the same object to take several forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better explain the concept, imagine robots with different characteristics: steering wheel, four legs, two legs.  All these three types of robots move and move, but all three do so in a different way interpreting the action in a completely different way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism is just that, i.e. it indicates the attitude of an object to show more implementations for a single functionality.  \n",

    "### Abstraction\n",
    "One of the main peculiarities of object oriented programming is to make software maintenance easy, streamlined and efficient.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of data abstraction further reinforces these strengths, particularly with regard to the reuse of code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is therefore used to better manage the complexity of a program, i.e. it is applied to decompose complex software systems into smaller and simpler components that can be managed more easily and efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best definitions on the concept of Data Abstraction is that of Booch: \"An abstraction must denote the essential characteristics of an object distinguishing it from all other objects and providing, in this way, precise conceptual boundaries with respect to the observer's perspective\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the former, the Robot class is an Abstract class, i.e. a class that basically represents a model for obtaining more specific and detailed derived classes!  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In an abstract class, usually few methods are contained (usually one or two) for which the implementation is also provided while for all other methods there is only a mere definition of the method itself and it is, therefore, necessary (and mandatory) that all descending classes provide the appropriate implementation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods belonging to this last typology (and which are defined in the abstract class) are called Abstract Methods. In the limit case in which an abstract class contains only abstract methods then it will be catalogued more correctly as an interface (see the section on interfaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "As said, the use of data abstraction (combined with the concept of inheritance) facilitates the reuse of code and streamlines the design of a software system. In fact, if the need arises, it will be easy to define other intermediate classes that can make use of the definitions already present in the abstract classes. In addition, it will be extremely useful to be able to reuse the abstract classes already defined, even in other projects."
